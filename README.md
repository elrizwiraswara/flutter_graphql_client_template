# flutter_graphql_client_template
A basic template for creating a GraphQL client in Flutter.
## Description
The flutter_graphql_client_template is a foundational template designed to facilitate the development of GraphQL clients in Flutter. This template provides a basic structure that includes the necessary components for establishing a connection with a GraphQL server and executing queries and mutations.

Whether youâ€™re a seasoned developer or just starting out with Flutter and GraphQL, this template serves as a great starting point, speeding up the initial setup process and promoting best practices in GraphQL client development.

Please note that while this template provides a basic structure, you may need to modify and adapt it according to the specific requirements of your project.
